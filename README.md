# Coding-Quiz
For this coding quiz I meant to provide you with a simple quiz on javascript basics.
The idea was to have the user on a timer that would also serve as their score.
A correct question would result in a message saying nice job while an incorrect message would inform you that you were wrong and deduct 15 second from your timer.
Unfortunately I couldnt get the wrong button to deliver a response. Instead, you will continue to lose 15 seconds until you get it correct and the Nice Job message wont go away once you receive it one time. 
At the end of the quiz the goal was to inform you of your time score and let you record it. Unfortunately since I got stuck on answer feedback, I will continue to work through until I find that solution so that the quiz can accurately log the users score, but at this point the quiz remains incomplete.
